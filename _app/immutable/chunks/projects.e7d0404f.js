---

[Chlorofell](https://games.digipen.edu/games/chlorofell/) is a top-down faux-isometric 2d shooter game with manual reloading and elemental ammo as core mechanics. The game was created at DigiPen Institute of technology by a team of 12 students comprising of programmers, game designers, artists, and a sound designer. The game is written in the custom C++ [Flintlock Engine](http://rymanb.com/projects/flintlock), and was developed over a year.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Primary Contributions</h1>

---

### Mock Tech Lead
I acted as the tech Lead for the duration of development. As a tech lead, I was responsible for holding frequent code review sessions and standup meatings, drafting codebase documentation, enforcing good code practices and style, and actively communicating between various other specialties to ensure the product was on track.

<br>

### Ray-casted Lighting system
The engine utilizes a real-time lighting system that can handle many light sources at a time on most modern computers. It supports various light sizes, colors that blend, and different behaviors such as a pulse or siren animation.

<br>

### Gameplay and Engine Systems
Contributed to several gameplay features such as the play controller, enemy detection indicators, ammo drops, true type font integration, debug tools for pathfinding, Memory Manager, and assisting with pathfinding and general game optimizations.

The Flintlock game engine is a custom C++ game engine built at DigiPen Institute of Technology. The Initial Purpose for developing the engine was for the game [Chlorofell](http://rymanb.com/projects/chlorofell), however, the engine is flexible enough to support the development of other games such as [Elemental Surge](http://rymanb.com/projects/elementalsurge).
