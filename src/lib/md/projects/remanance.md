[Remanance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3564370/Remanence/) is a first-person souls-like that rewards players for mastering the sword combat mechanics. In the remains of a world where technology has progressed to the level of seeming magical, players take the role of a survivor of the apocalypse who aims to rise against the robotic cult that has destroyed the world using nanomachines. Armed with only a sword and little remaining nanomachine power, players must master sword combat and seek revenge on the cybernetic overlord. In their path is an army of machines with a variety of attacks. Some war machines are fast and nimble while others are slow but hit hard. It is up to the player to figure out the best approach to dispatch their opponent.

### Gameplay and tools programmer
I was a primary contiributor to several gameplay systems including, player sword play, player magic blast, magic slash, syringe system, UI implementation, dynamic world events, and a dynamic and seamless save system allowing auto save of game objects without requiring any extra programming to do so.

Additionally I created several tools for designers and artists to assist in development, for example: Discord change log bot, PostgreSQL database and CRUD interface to be used with Telemetry system, as well as several other in game tools that assisted in the development of the game.
