### Ray-casted Lighting system
The engine utilizes a real-time lighting system that can handle many light sources at a time on most modern computers. It supports various light sizes, colors that blend, and different behaviors such as a pulse or siren animation.

Contributed to several gameplay features such as the play controller, enemy detection indicators, ammo drops, true type font integration, debug tools for pathfinding, Memory Manager, and assisting with pathfinding and general game optimizations.
